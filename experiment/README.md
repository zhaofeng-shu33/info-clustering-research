## Data Clustering
We did a simple comparision between 5 different clustering methods on 5 different datasets. 
The score table is called `compare.tex` and is an input to `main.tex`. If you don't want to run the experiment locally,
you can download [compare.tex](http://data-visualization.leidenschaft.cn/research/info-clustering/code/utility/compare.tex).
If you use linux os, you can use `Makefile` to handle the dependencies.

About post processing
After the experiments are done, table and figures are generated, which should
be copied to paper directory for better integration.
