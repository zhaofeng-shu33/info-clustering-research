\title{Improving Algorithm of PSP}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

In the original formulation to calculate principal sequence of partition. A Divide and Conquer approach is used and $\min_{\P} \{f[\P]-\lambda \abs{\P}\}$ is evaluated only at finite $\lambda$. However, computation for different $\lambda$ is independent and does not use the nesting property of the PSP. Therefore, we propose an improved version of PSP, which utilitizes the nesting property to decrease the time complexity of the algorithm.

Generally speaking, we first solve $\min_{\P} \{ f[\P]-\lambda \abs{\P} \}$ at $\lambda_1 = \frac{w}{\abs{V}-1}$ where $w$ is the summation of all edge capacity. Then for those $\lambda > \lambda_1$ we do not need to compute for the whole graph $G$. Suppose $\P_1 = \argmin_{\P} \{ f[\P]-\lambda \abs{\P} \}$ and for each $ C \in \P_1$, it is sufficient to consider subgraph $G'$ constraint on node set $C$. That is, we compute the clustering tree starting with tree root $C$ instead of $V$. For $\lambda < \lambda_1$, a graph contraction technique can be used. That is, the graph $G$ can be contracted to $\abs{\P_1}$ parts and the same algorithm can be run with the same root node $V$ but it has different children this time (previously, all children of $V$ is $\{j\}$, afterwards it is $C$ for $C \in \P_1$.

The tricky part of the implementation is how to construct the whole clustering tree $\mathcal{T}$.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}\label{alg:psp_a}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE a directed graph $G(V, E)$; edge cost function $c(e)$ for $e\in E$
\ENSURE a hierarchical tree $\mathcal{T}(K, E)$ where $K$ is node set and $E$ is edge set; $c'$ as edge weight map. Each non-leaf node of $\mathcal{T}$ is an info-cluster and each edge weight is a critical value. 
\STATE initialize a set list $K=[V, \{1\}, \dots, \{V\}]$, a tree $\mathcal{T}$ with 0 as root node, $j(j\leq \abs{V})$ as leaf node and no stem node.
\STATE \texttt{Split}(0)
\FUNCTION{\texttt{Split}$(i)$}
\STATE Let $T=\{K[j][0] | \texttt{parent}(j) = i\}$
\STATE Consider subgraph $G'$ constraint on set $T$. $w$ is the summation of all edge weights within $G'$ 
\STATE $\gamma' = \frac{w}{\abs{T}-1}$ \label{line:intersection}  \label{alg:T}
\STATE $(\tilde{h}, P') = \texttt{DT}(G', \gamma')$
\IF{$\tilde{h} = - \gamma'$}
\STATE add edge weight $\gamma'$ starting from $i$ to its children. \label{alg:add_lambda}
\ELSE
\FOR{$S$ in $P'$ and $\abs{S}>1$}
\STATE Let $S'=S$, $s=\abs{K}$% index(S) = |K|
\FOR{child $j$ of $i$}
\IF{$K[j]\cap S \neq \emptyset$}
\STATE \texttt{parent}$(j)=s, S'=S'\cup K[j]$
\ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE \texttt{parent}$(s)=i$, append $S'$ to $K$
\STATE \texttt{Split}(s)
\STATE within the graph $G$, contract $S$ to $S$[0]
\ENDFOR
\STATE \texttt{Split}$(i)$ % the graph is modified
\ENDIF
\ENDFUNCTION
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
In line \ref{line:intersection}, since we are considering the intersection of $-\lambda$ and $w-\abs{T}\lambda $.

The idea of the improved PSP algorithm can be generalized to get a hierarchical community detection algorithm from any "flatten" algorithm ( which can only get one-level structure of a community ).

It is found that our implementation of info-clustering cannot handle very small capacity value. For a given $\epsilon$, let capacity equal to zero if it is less than $\epsilon$.

Early stopping technique, if $\abs{T}=2$ on line \ref{alg:T}, then we can skip directly to line \ref{alg:add_lambda}.

The graph contraction is summation of absolute values.

Increasing set version of  \texttt{DT} algorithm only support $(i,j) \in E \Rightarrow i<j$.

\section{Agglomerative method}
Another version of psp can be implemented agglomeratively.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{}\label{alg:psp_agg}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE a directed graph $G(V, E)$; edge cost function $c(e)$ for $e\in E$
\ENSURE a hierarchical tree $\mathcal{T}(K, E)$ where $K$ is node set and $E$ is edge set; $c'$ as edge weight map. Each non-leaf node of $\mathcal{T}$ is an info-cluster and each edge weight is a critical value. 
\STATE initialize a set list $K=[V, \{1\}, \dots, \{V\}]$, a tree $\mathcal{T}$ with 0 as root node, $j(j\leq \abs{V})$ as leaf node and no stem node.
\STATE \texttt{Merge}(0,0)
\FUNCTION{\texttt{Merge}$(i,j)$}
\STATE $j' = \texttt{children}(i)[j]$
\STATE Compute $C^* =\displaystyle \argmax_{K[j'][0] \in C \subseteq V \cap K[i]} \frac{w(C)}{\abs{C}-1}$ where $w$ is the summation of all edge weights within set $C$. \label{line:max}
\IF{$C^* = K[i]$}
\STATE remove node $K[i][j]$ from the graph
\IF{$j< \texttt{len(children}(i))$}
\STATE \texttt{Merge}$(i,j+1)$
\ENDIF
\ELSE
\STATE $\widetilde{C} = C^*, s=\abs{K}$
\FOR{$r \in \texttt{children}(i)$}
\IF{$K[r] \cap C^* \neq \emptyset$}
\STATE  $\texttt{parent}(r) = s, \widetilde{C} = \widetilde{C} \cup K[r]$
\ENDIF
\STATE append $\widetilde{C} $ to $K$
\ENDFOR
\STATE $\texttt{parent}(s) = i$
\STATE \texttt{Merge}$(s,0)$
\STATE Within graph $G$, contract $C^*$ to $K[j'][0]$
\STATE \texttt{Merge}$(i,j)$
\ENDIF
\ENDFUNCTION
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
The key is to solve the maximum in line \ref{line:max}.
We only need to consider a subgraph $G'$ with node set $V \cap K[i]$.
We denote the function to be maximized as
\begin{equation}
J_T(Z_C) = \frac{w(C)}{\abs{C}-1}
\end{equation}
This comes from the bottom-up approach of info-clustering. We do not need to maximize over $I(Z_C)$. Instead, we maximize over $J_T(Z_C)$.

Consider
\begin{equation}\label{eq:setdt}
g(\lambda) = \min_{C\subset V, t \in C} \{ H(C) + \lambda\abs{C}\}
\end{equation}
where $H(C) = f(C) - \sum_{i\in C} f(\{i\})$. Denote $a_i = f(\{i\}), y^{\lambda}_i = x_i - \lambda$. Then equation \ref{eq:setdt} can be simplified as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:setdt}
g(\lambda) &= \min_{C\subset V, t \in C} g_{\lambda}(C) \\
g_{\lambda}(C)  & = f(C) - y^{\lambda}(C)
\end{align}
The function defined in the above equation is piecewise linear about $\lambda$. 
% Its property is explored fully in my nips 2019 paper submission.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:LastCriticalValue}
The largest turning point of $g(\lambda)$ is denoted as $\gamma_N$, which equals $\max_{C\subset V, t\in C}J_T(Z_C)$
\end{theorem}

The last line segment of $g(\lambda)$ is $\lambda$.
\begin{proof}[Proof of theorem \ref{thm:LastCriticalValue}]
\begin{align*}
\gamma_N & = \max_{C\subset V: \abs{C}>1} J_T(Z_C) \\
& = \min\{\lambda : \lambda \geq \frac{-H(C)}{\abs{C}-1} \textrm{ for all $C\subset V$ and $ t\in C$}\} \\
& = \min\{\lambda : \lambda \leq H(C)+\lambda\abs{C} \textrm{ for all $C\subset V$ and $t \in C$}\} \\
& = \min\{\lambda : \lambda \leq g(\lambda) \} \textrm{ holds for } \abs{C}=1
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
