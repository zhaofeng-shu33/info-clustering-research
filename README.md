# Introduction
This project contains the in-progress research about info-clustering. 
It can be divided into three parts in general:

* research document, paper, presentation slide and poster material
* experiment code and result, see the subdirectory `experiment` for detail.
* [info-clustering](https://github.com/zhaofeng-shu33/principal_sequence_of_partition) implementation, see the submodule `code` for detail.

## Research document
 * `main.tex` : presentation slides
 * `clustering.tex` : article about original Dilworth truncation algorithm.
 * `pmf.tex`: article about parametric Dilworth truncation algorithm. 
 * `psp_improved.tex`: article about improved principal sequence of partition algorithm.

### Template 
The presentation uses a beamer template customized for TBSI Lab2C, which is based on `Madrid`, modified by [xiangxiang-xu](https://xiangxiangxu.com/)
and packaged by *zhaofeng-shu33*. If you want to use it in your beamer presentation, follows:

```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{Lab2C}
%other materials
```
