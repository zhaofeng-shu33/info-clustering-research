# Introduction
This project is document oriented and uses the result generated from the code project.
Actually, it uses the code project as a submodule.

The document project provides `main.tex` and `clustering.tex`. The first is the presentation and the second is the article.

The presentation uses a beamer template customized for TBSI Lab2C, which is based on `Madrid`, modified by [xiangxiang-xu](https://xiangxiangxu.com/)
and packaged by *zhaofeng-shu33*. If you want to use it in your beamer presentation, follows:
```latex
\documentclass{beamer}
\usetheme{Lab2C}
%other materials
```
