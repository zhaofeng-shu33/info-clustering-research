For graph weight function $f(A)$, it has the following property:
\begin{equation}
f(A) + f(B) = f(A\cup B) + f(A \cap B)
\end{equation}
If the graph weight is interpreted as distance metric and we use $D_{\P}(Z_V)$ instead of $I_{\P}(Z_V)$,
also 
\begin{equation}
D(Z_V) = \max_{\P \in \Pi'(V)} D_{\P}(Z_V)
\end{equation}
which describes the average distance shared between multiple random variables.

Then by solving $h(\lambda)$, we can get a hierachical solution.
\begin{equation}
h(\lambda) = \max\{f[\P] - \lambda\abs{\P},\forall \P\}
\end{equation}
However, solving $h(\lambda)$ is related to solving \texttt{MAX-CUT}, which is NP-HARD.
