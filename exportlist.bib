The new features include (i) building gene-based and supermatrix-based phylogenies using a single command, (ii) testing and visualizing evolutionary models, (iii) calculating distances between trees of different size or including duplications, and (iv) providing seamless integration with the NCBI taxonomy database.

Here, we introduce and validate an unsupervised method for extracting the hierarchical organization of complex biological, social, and technological networks. We define an ensemble of hierarchically nested random graphs, which we use to validate the method. We then apply our method to real-world networks, including the air-transportation network, an electronic circuit, an e-mail exchange network, and metabolic networks. Our analysis of model and real networks demonstrates that our method extracts an accurate multiscale representation of a complex system.},
