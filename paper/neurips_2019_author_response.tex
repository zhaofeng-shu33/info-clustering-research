\begin{document}
Thanks for the constructive comments made by all three reviewers.
Below is our response. The literature reference number follows the submitted paper reference list. 

\textbf{Common Response: Insufficient Experiment}
Our paper presents experimental results mainly on synthetic datasets but good results can also be achieved on other real-world hierarchical data. The evaluation result on NIPS authorship-234 dataset is presented below, in comparison with BHCD [2] using three metric: true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate(TNR) and accuracy (ACC).

\textbf{Common Response: Novelty and Contribution}
In theoretical model level, our paper proposed a new graph-based hierarchical clustering method (Definition 1)and analyze the hierarchical tree structure for some graph weight configuration(Proposition 1 and 3). In algorithmic level, our paper proposed a  succinct computing scheme (Algorithm 1) for parametric maximum flow and prove its equivalence and correctness(Proposition 2 and Theorem 4).
