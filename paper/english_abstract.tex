We propose a graph-based hierarchical clustering method based on a multivariate information metric.
The proposed method can generate non-binary hierarchical tree that reveals the intrinsic structures in the data, with no hyper-parameter to tune. 
The hierarchical tree can be computed efficiently by 
invoking parametric maximum flow algorithm. 
Experiments show that the clustering result outperforms
other hierarchical clustering techniques and is very suitable to find the complex community structure.
