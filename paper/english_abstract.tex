We propose a new hierarchical graph clustering method based on a multivariate information metric.
The proposed method can generate satisfied non-binary hierachical tree for a graph with no hyperparameter to tune. 
The hierachical tree can be computed efficiently by 
invoking parametric maximal flow algorithm. 
Experiments show that the clustering result is competent with 
other hierachical clustering technique and very suitable to find the complex community structure.
