We propose a new hierarchical graph clustering method based on a multivariate information metric.
The proposed method can generate satisfied non-binary hierarchical tree for a graph with no hyper-parameter to tune. 
The hierarchical tree can be computed efficiently by 
invoking parametric maximal flow algorithm. 
Experiments show that the clustering result is competent with 
other hierarchical clustering technique and very suitable to find the complex community structure.
