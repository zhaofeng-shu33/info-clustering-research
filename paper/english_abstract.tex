  We propose a new hierachical clustering method based on a multivariate information metric, which is computable in polynomial time. The proposed method generate different hierachical tree by scaling the metric used. The hierachical tree can be computed efficiently in polynomial time by invoking parametric maximal flow algorithm. Experiment shows that clustering result is competent with other hierachical clustering technique or genral clustering method.
