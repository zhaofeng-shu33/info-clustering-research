\begin{proposition}[info-clustering]\label{prop:ta}
The following two procedures generate the same hierarchical tree. Each non-leaf node of the hierarchical tree is represented by a subset $S \subset V$, which is called a cluster of graph $G$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a graph $G$, suppose $I_{\P^*}(Z_V)=I(Z_V)$, each subset of $\P^*$ is a child of hierachical tree root $V$. For each child node set $C$, use partition $\P_C$($I(Z_C)=I_{\P_C}(Z_C)$) to split it until this branch is divided into singletons.
\item For a graph $G$, suppose $I(Z_C) = \max_{B\subseteq V} I(Z_B)$ and $C$ is maximal, merge singleton element of $C$ together and contract $G$. At each step select the set with maximal multivariate similarity to contract the graph until the graph is contracted to a single node, which is the tree root.
\end{enumerate}
