\begin{proposition}\label{prop:ta}
The following two procedures generate the same hierachical tree.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a graph $G$, suppose $I_{\P}(Z_V)=I(Z_V)$, each subset of $\P$ is child of hierachical tree root $V$. For each tree leaf node set $C$, use partition $\P_C$($I(Z_C)=I_{\P_C}(Z_C)$) to split it until the leaf node has exactly one element.
\item For a graph $G$, suppose $I(Z_C) = \max_{B\subseteq V} I(Z_B)$ and $C$ is maximal, merge singleton element of $C$ together and $G$ is contracted. At each step select the set with maximal multivariate similarity to contract the graph until the graph contracted to one vertex.
\end{enumerate}
